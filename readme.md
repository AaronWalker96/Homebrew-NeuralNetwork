# Homebrew - Neural Network
In order to test my knowledge on neural networks I decided to build one from scratch, not implementing any machine learning libraries. This is a simple neural net with 2 input nodes and one output node, at the moment the training data is random numbers, but I'll eventually make it something useful... 

## Usage 
This is a simple project and is contained within one .py file. Run the neural net using the `python neuralnetwork.py`. The output is written to the console.
